# Game Jam Practice
A game made in 24 hours for game jam practice.
The topics were phantoms, graveyards, and cauldrons. I chose phantoms.
The goal is to get both PCs to their respective exits. The player must be in human form to leave the tomb. 
Both characters are controlled simultaneously with WASD.
The space bar is used to swap bodies with your ghost friend.
The phantom can only harm (and will only chase) the human character.
Beware though, once one PC escapes, the other will no longer be able to swap with the ghost friend, leaving them vulnerable to the phantom. There are 6 levels.
